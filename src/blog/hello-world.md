# Hello World
## 4/5/2023
Welcome! This will be my very first blog post! I still have lots of work to do to polish this website, but for my first real attempt, I think it turned out rather well. These blog posts will not just be about programming, because I'll also be writing about other topics like video games.

I need some suggestions about fun things to add, the website is a bit empty. So if you have any ideas please let me know. It's pretty late right now so I think I'm going to stop writing.

Until then, godspeed.
